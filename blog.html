            <h4>Abstracts Art: A Definition</h4>
            <p>Abstract art uses visual language of shape, form, color and line to create a composition which may exist with a degree of independence from visual references in the world. Western art had been, from the Renaissance up to the middle of the 19th century, underpinned by the logic of perspective and an attempt to reproduce an illusion of visible reality. By the end of the 19th century many artists felt a need to create a new kind of art which would encompass the fundamental changes taking place in technology, science and philosophy.</p>

            <h4>Abstracts Expressionism</h4>
            <p>Abstract expressionism is a post–World War II art movement in American painting, developed in New York City in the 1940s. It was the first specifically American movement to achieve international influence and put New York at the center of the Western art world, a role formerly filled by Paris. Although the term "abstract expressionism" was first applied to American art in 1946 by the art critic Robert Coates, it had been first used in Germany in 1919 in the magazine Der Sturm, regarding German Expressionism. Technically, an important predecessor is surrealism, with its emphasis on spontaneous, automatic, or subconscious creation.</p>

            <h4>Abstracts Photography</h4>
            <p>Abstract photography, sometimes called non-objective, experimental or conceptual photography, is a means of depicting a visual image that does not have an immediate association with the object world and that has been created through the use of photographic equipment, processes or materials. An abstract photograph may isolate a fragment of a natural scene in order to remove its inherent context from the viewer, it may be purposely staged to create a seemingly unreal appearance.</p>

            <h4>About Me</h4>
            <br>
              <p>My name is Shakearah McNeil, and I am from Baltimore, Maryland. I have attended Full Sail University and the University of Baltimore with a background in Communications. I have enjoyed art for a great deal of my life; started drawing at 3 and I have a trained eye for design, especially in abstracts. Over the past 20 years I have developed a passion for science and technology, and I have sought ways to combine my passions. I admire Leonardo da Vinci who was a scientist, engineer, and painter during his lifetime. It is his example that leaves me to believe that there's always room for art in technology. I am also a firm believer that there are opportunities in obstacles. Many of the best moments of my life came to be from obstacles.  </p>
